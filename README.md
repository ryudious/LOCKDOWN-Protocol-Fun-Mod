**Author:** Ryudious

## Overview

This mod enhances your in-game experience by replacing all original music tracks and tutorial videos with iconic songs and funny videos. Enjoy a new level of immersion with music you love and share laughs with friends in the lobby area as you prepare for your next adventure.

## Features

- **Custom Music:** Every in-game music track has been replaced with well-known, iconic songs.
- **Funny Videos:** The lobby's tutorial videos are now humorous clips that will have you and your friends laughing.
- **Planned Update:** Due to current issues with the game's use of Data Tables, the names of the songs have not been updated in the UI. A future update will include correct titles and artist names once this issue is resolved.

5. **Launch** the game and enjoy your new custom music and funny videos!

## Known Issues

- **UI Song Titles:** The song titles in the UI have not been updated due to an issue with the game's Data Tables. This will be addressed in a future update.
